# Tech Taboo 🎯

Tech Taboo is a lightweight, open-source browser game inspired by the classic Taboo game.
The goal is simple: **explain a technical concept without using common buzzwords**.

It’s designed for JavaScript meetups, team learning sessions, onboarding, and interview prep —
anywhere clarity of understanding matters more than memorization.

## How the Game Works

- One player explains the **term shown on screen**
- A list of **forbidden words** is visible
- The audience tries to guess the term
- If a forbidden word is spoken → **skip the card**
- A **timer and buzzer** keep the pace fast
- Keyboard shortcuts and mobile support included

The game encourages explaining ideas clearly, without relying on buzzwords.

## Deck Format

Decks are simple JSON files.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "JavaScript Basics",
  "cards": [
    {
      "term": "Closure",
      "forbidden": ["function", "scope", "variable", "lexical"]
    },
    {
      "term": "Promise",
      "forbidden": ["async", "await", "then", "callback"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### To add a new deck

1. Create a new JSON file in decks/

2. Add it to decks/index.json

3. Reload the app

No code changes needed.

## Why This Project Exists

In many tech discussions, people know the terminology but struggle to explain the underlying idea. Tech Taboo is a small experiment to encourage clear thinking, simple explanations, and better communication.

It was built in about 5–6 hours as a focused learning-in-public project.
